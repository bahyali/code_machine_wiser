# LLM-Powered SQL Query System

## Description

This project aims to build a system that allows users to interact with a PostgreSQL database using natural language queries. It leverages Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4o, to understand user intent, generate SQL queries, execute them, and synthesize natural language responses.

## Features (Planned)

- Natural Language Query Input
- Intent Analysis (Chit-chat, Data Retrieval, Insights)
- Chit-chat Handling
- Database Schema Access
- SQL Query Generation (Data Retrieval & Insights)
- SQL Query Execution
- Iterative Querying for Insights
- SQL Error Handling and Correction
- Response Compilation and Generation
- Data Presentation and Formatting (Counts as whole numbers, Revenue in SAR)
